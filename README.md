## Beginning of the way

### Description

This repository is one of my first attempts in code, showing my acquaintance with IT sphere. I had thoughts about deleting this repo, but I decided to keep it here for showing difference, compared with my today's code, and my IT education progress.

So, this repo works [here](https://pesochenski.github.io/pesochenski_test_animation/).

Also you can download it, but I'm not sure you need to do this.
